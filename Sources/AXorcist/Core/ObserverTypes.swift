/// combinations of processes and notification types.

/// Pairs an AXObserver instance with the process ID it's monitoring,
/// used for managing the lifecycle of accessibility observers.

/// Token returned when subscribing to accessibility notifications.
///
/// Use this token to unsubscribe from notifications when they're no longer needed.
/// The token ensures that only the original subscriber can cancel the subscription.

/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let token = observerCenter.subscribe(to: .valueChanged, for: pid) { ... }
/// // Later...
/// observerCenter.unsubscribe(token)
/// ```
public struct SubscriptionToken: Hashable {
    /// Unique identifier for this subscription.
